# Data Structures and Algorithm

My note

### What makes a good algorithm

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

Data Structure: How to organize
Algorithm: How to fetch data

### Types Of Data Structures

1. Primitive Data structures
   - [ ] Integer
   - [ ] Float
   - [ ] Float
   - [ ] Character
   - [ ] String
   - [ ] Boolean
2. Non-Primitive Data Structures
   - [x] Linear
   - [ ] Static
   1. Array -[x] Dynamic
   1. Linked List
   1. Stack
   1. Queue -[x] Non Linear
   - [ ] Tree
   - [ ] Graph

### Types of Algorithm

1. Simple recursive
2. Divide and conquer
3. Dynamic programming
4. Greedy
5. Brute force
6. Randomized
