# CQS

Command Query Seperation

`A command (procedure) does something but does not return a result. A query (function or attribute) returns a result but does not change the state.` - Bertrand Meyer

# CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Segregation

`The fundamental difference is that in CQRS objects are split into two objects, one containing the Commands one containing the Queries.` - Greg Young
