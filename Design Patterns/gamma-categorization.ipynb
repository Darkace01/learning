    "## Creational Design Patterns\n",
    "- Deal with the creation ( construction ) of objects.\n",
    "- Explicit ( Constructor ) vs. implicit ( DI, reflection, etc. ).\n",

    "## Structural Design Patterns\n",
    "- Concerned with the composition of classes or objects.\n",
    "- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.\n",
